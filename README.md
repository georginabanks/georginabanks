<h1>Welcome to my GitHub repository!</h1>

Hi! I'm Georgina, a software engineer with an interest in coding programs that are useful in the field of medicine 🧪🧬 This repository contains various projects and code snippets that I have worked on as I continue to learn and improve my skills in programming.

<h2>📚 Currently Studying</h2>

I am currently studying software engineering at HyperionDev. By the end of this course, I will have gained a lot of experience in designing and developing code for a wide variety of projects, such as finance calculators and task managers, and will be proficient in Python, Django, HTML, CSS and MySQL. I have previous experience building websites using WordPress, including HTML and CSS, and working with WP Themes and Plug-Ins.

<h2>🌱 Getting Started</h2>

To get started, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once you have Python set up, you can clone my repositories to your local machine by following the instructions on GitHub Docs ‘Cloning a repository’ (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

<h2>🔭 Project Overview</h2>

I'm currently working on my first few projects - they'll be up here as soon as they're ready! 

<h2>👯‍♀️ Contributing</h2>

If you would like to contribute to any of these projects or have any suggestions for new projects, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. As a beginner, I am always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
